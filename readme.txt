A repository for MLB data, primarily visualizations.


Play by play, boxscore, and game log data is taken from Retrosheet:

     The information used here was obtained free of
     charge from and is copyrighted by Retrosheet.  Interested
     parties may contact Retrosheet at "www.retrosheet.org".


The original pitch-by-pitch data comes from the Pyramid Rating System, created by Paul Moehringer, a writer at Fangraphs.

This also uses the Lahman Database, available at http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/
I have included the csv files here. On my local machine, I inserted the csv files into a SQL database for storage and ease of access
